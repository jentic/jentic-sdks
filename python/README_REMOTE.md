## Overview

Jentic lets you execute code and automate workflows remotely, making it easy to build intelligent agents, integrate APIs, and manage distributed tasks.

<!-- Optionally add a diagram here -->

---

## Architecture

<!-- Add a simple diagram or bullet points explaining the architecture -->

- **Client SDK**: Python interface for interacting with the Jentic runtime.
- **Remote Runtime**: Secure environment for executing code and workflows.
- **API Gateway**: Handles authentication, routing, and orchestration.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A valid Jentic API key ([Get one here](https://your-signup-link))

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install jentic
```

## Authentication

 **Note:** The client looks for an explicit `api_key` argument or the environment variable `JENTIC_AGENT_API_KEY`.

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export JENTIC_AGENT_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Or pass it directly in code:

```python
import jentic
client = jentic.Jentic(jentic.AgentConfig(api_key="your-key-here"))
```

---

## Quick Start

### List APIs

```python
import jentic
apis = await jentic.list_apis()
print(apis)
```

### Search

```python
results = await jentic.search("send message to discord channel")
print(results)
```

### Execute an Operation

```python
resp = await jentic.execute(
    jentic.ExecutionRequest(
        execution_type="operation",
        uuid="operation_id",
        inputs={"arg1": "value1"}
    )
)
print(resp)
```

> **Note:** For sync code, use `asyncio.run()`:

```python
import asyncio
import jentic

apis = asyncio.run(jentic.list_apis())
print(apis)
```
