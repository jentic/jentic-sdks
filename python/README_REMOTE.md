## Overview
A minimal guide to installing the Jentic Python SDK and executing code on a remote Jentic runtime.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- A valid Jentic API key

## Installation

```bash
pip install jentic
```

## Authentication

> **Note:**
> The client looks for an explicit `api_key` argument or the environment variable `JENTIC_AGENT_API_KEY`.

```bash
export JENTIC_AGENT_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## Quick Start

### Async Usage

```python
import jentic

apis = await jentic.list_apis()
print(apis)

results = await jentic.search("discord search message")
print(results)

resp = await jentic.execute(
    jentic.ExecutionRequest(
        execution_type="operation",
        uuid="operation_id",
        inputs={"arg1": "value1"}
    )
)
print(resp)
```

### Sync Context

If running in a sync context, you can use `asyncio.run()`:

```python
import asyncio
import jentic

apis = asyncio.run(jentic.list_apis())
print(apis)
```
