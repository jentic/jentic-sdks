# Jentic MCP Plugin

## Why Use Jentic MCP?

Jentic MCP empowers developers to discover and integrate external APIs and workflows rapidly—without the need to write or maintain any API-specific code. By leveraging the MCP protocol and Jentic’s agentic runtime, developers can:

- Search for APIs and workflows by capability, not by vendor or implementation.
- Instantly generate integration code samples that are agnostic to specific API details.
- Avoid boilerplate and reduce maintenance by relying on standardized, declarative integration.
- Focus on building features, while Jentic MCP handles the complexity of API interaction.

## API Tools

The Jentic MCP Plugin provides the following tools:

- `search_apis`: Search for APIs in the Jentic directory that match specific functionality needs
- `get_execution_configuration`: Retrieve detailed specifications for APIs and operations from the Jentic directory
- `generate_code_sample`: Generate a code sample to quickly allow a coding agent to integrate a codebase with Jentic tools

## Use Local Jentic SDK

To use a local Jentic SDK for development purposes, run `pdm add ../path/to/sdk`. This will add the local Jentic SDK to the jentic-mcp project's dependencies.

### Windsurf Integration

To integrate the jentic-mcp plugin with Windsurf, create or update your `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` file. Be sure to update `path/to/jentic/mcp` to the absolute path of your jentic-mcp project directory.

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "jentic-mcp": {
            "command": "pdm",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "--project",
                "/path/to/jentic/mcp",
                "mcp",
                "serve",
                "--transport",
                "stdio"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

_Optional:_ Add a `JENTIC_API_URL` environment variable to your mcp_config.json file to point to a specific Jentic API:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "jentic-mcp": {
            ...
            "env": {
                "JENTIC_API_URL": "http://localhost:8000/"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/jentic/mcp` with the absolute path to your jentic-mcp project directory.

Once configured, restart Windsurf, and the Jentic MCP tools will be available to your agents.

You can tail the logs generated by the locally running MCP server by running:

```bash
tail /path/to/mcp/jentic_ark2_mcp.log
```

## Installation

```bash
pdm install
```

## Running the MCP Server in Development Modes

The jentic-mcp plugin supports multiple transport modes and configuration options.
 
### Transport Modes

#### HTTP Mode (Default)

Run the MCP plugin as a HTTP server:

```bash
# Default (port 8010)
pdm run mcp-http

# With custom port
pdm run mcp serve --transport http --port 8080

# With custom host
pdm run mcp serve --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# With mock mode (for development)
pdm run mcp-mock-http
```

#### Stdio Mode (for Windsurf Integration)

Run the MCP plugin in stdio mode, which follows the JSON-RPC protocol for Windsurf compatibility:

```bash
# Basic stdio mode
pdm run mcp-stdio

# With mock mode (for development)
pdm run mcp-mock-stdio

# With debug logging for stdio communication
pdm run mcp-debug-stdio
```

### Configuration Options

#### Logging

```bash
# Set logging level
pdm run mcp serve --transport http --log-level DEBUG
pdm run mcp serve --transport stdio --log-level DEBUG

# Available levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
# Default: INFO

# Log to file
pdm run mcp serve --transport http --log-file jentic_mcp.log
```

#### Mock Mode

For development purposes, you can use the mock mode which doesn't require connecting to the actual Jentic API Knowledge Hub.

```bash
# Use the dedicated mock commands
pdm run mcp-mock-http
pdm run mcp-mock-stdio

# Or explicitly enable mock mode
pdm run mcp serve --transport http --mock
pdm run mcp serve --transport stdio --mock
```

#### Environment Variables

You can provide environment variables using a .env file:

```bash
pdm run mcp serve --transport http --env-file .env
```

### Using with Claude

The MCP plugin can be used with Claude or other LLMs that support the MCP specification:

```
claude-cli --mcp http://localhost:8000
```

## Development

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development instructions for both packages.
